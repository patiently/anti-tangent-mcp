## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `validate_plan` now automatically chunks large plans so reviewer responses don't truncate mid-JSON. Plans with more than `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_TASKS_PER_CHUNK` tasks (default 8) are reviewed via one Pass-1 plan-findings call plus `ceil(n/N)` per-chunk calls; the merged `PlanResult` is identical in shape to the single-call path. Plans of 8 tasks or fewer take the existing single-call path unchanged.
- Three new optional env vars: `ANTI_TANGENT_PER_TASK_MAX_TOKENS` (default 4096) governs output budget for `validate_task_spec` / `check_progress` / `validate_completion`; `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_MAX_TOKENS` (default 4096) governs output budget for `validate_plan` (single-call and per-chunk); `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_TASKS_PER_CHUNK` (default 8) sets both the chunking threshold and per-chunk task count. All three reject zero / negative / non-integer values at startup.
- Per-chunk identity validation: the chunked path verifies every returned `task_title` matches one of the requested chunk's headings (no duplicates, exact count). Mismatch triggers the existing retry-once path; second failure surfaces as an error rather than partial results.
- Gated e2e test `TestValidatePlan_E2E_LargePlanChunked` (build tag `e2e` + `ANTI_TANGENT_E2E_LARGE=1`) exercising the chunked path against a live OpenAI reviewer with a 25-task plan.

### Fixed
- `validate_plan` returning `decode plan result: EOF` on plans of ~12+ tasks. Root cause was a hardcoded `MaxTokens: 4096` cap that the reviewer's JSON response was overflowing on dense plans; both the cap is now configurable and the chunking path keeps each individual response well within budget.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `google:gemini-3.1-pro-preview` and `google:gemini-3.1-flash-lite` to the reviewer-model allowlist (verified via the Gemini `models.list` endpoint as supporting `generateContent`).
- `openai:gpt-5.5` and `openai:gpt-5.4-mini` (bare-name aliases that route to the latest dated snapshot). Verified live against `/v1/chat/completions` with `response_format: json_object`. The dated `gpt-5.5-2026-04-23` and `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17` entries remain for callers who want pinned snapshots.
- README and `INTEGRATION.md`: opencode (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) registration example, and a "Supported reviewer models" table grouped by provider so callers can see what `ANTI_TANGENT_*_MODEL` accepts at a glance.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Release workflow: write the release-notes file to `$RUNNER_TEMP` instead of the checkout directory. The previous path (`.release-notes.md` in the work tree) made GoReleaser see a dirty git state and refuse to publish. Moving the file outside the work tree keeps the tree clean and lets GoReleaser run end-to-end without `--skip=validate`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added 
- Extending .gitignore with claude droppings
- Fixing release task 

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Initial release. MCP server (`anti-tangent-mcp`) exposing three tools that
  review implementing-subagent work at the start, middle, and end of a task:
  - `validate_task_spec` — checks structural completeness, AC quality, and
    unstated assumptions before coding begins.
  - `check_progress` — flags scope drift, untouched ACs, and unaddressed
    prior findings during implementation.
  - `validate_completion` — walks every AC and non-goal in a final review.
- Multi-provider reviewer support: Anthropic Messages API (tool_use),
  OpenAI Chat Completions (json_schema), Google Gemini generateContent
  (responseSchema). Per-hook model defaults overridable per call.
- In-memory session store with configurable TTL (default 4h).
- Cross-platform binaries via GoReleaser (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64).
- Distroless static container image published to ghcr.io.
- GitHub Actions CI (changelog enforcement, `go test -race`) and release
  workflow (commit-tag-driven semver bump, tag, GoReleaser, GHCR push).
- `validate_plan` MCP tool — plan-level handoff gate that reviews an entire implementation plan in one call and proposes ready-to-paste structured-header blocks (Goal / Acceptance criteria / Non-goals / Context) for tasks that lack them. Replaces the per-task plan-handoff loop.
- `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_MODEL` env var — overrides the model used by `validate_plan`. Defaults to `ANTI_TANGENT_PRE_MODEL`.
