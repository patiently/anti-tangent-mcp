# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Documentation for [CodeScene MCP](https://github.com/codescene-oss/codescene-mcp-server) as the recommended optional companion. Anti-tangent is text-only by design; CodeScene's deterministic Code Health analysis closes the codebase-grounded blind spot. New `### CodeScene MCP companion (optional)` section in `INTEGRATION.md` covers tool-to-phase mapping (`pre_commit_code_health_safeguard` mid-task, `analyze_change_set` before DONE), advisory posture, and lightweight-mode interaction. `README.md` gains an attribution + overview section.

### Changed
- Dispatch-clause template in `INTEGRATION.md` gains optional Step 2b (`pre_commit_code_health_safeguard` mid-task) and Step 3b (`analyze_change_set` before DONE). Both gated on "if codescene-mcp is configured in your host" — silent skip when absent. Anti-tangent itself is unchanged; the integration lives at the convention layer.
- `examples/lightweight-dispatch.md` notes that lightweight tasks skip the CodeScene companion calls too.

### Documentation
- New `### Companion tool: CodeScene MCP (optional)` section in `README.md` attributes [CodeScene](https://codescene.com) and describes the pairing.

Closes [#14](https://github.com/patiently/anti-tangent-mcp/issues/14).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- `summary_block` field on every tool response: paste-ready textual envelope (verdict, findings, model_used, review_ms, session_ttl_remaining_seconds) that implementers can copy verbatim into DONE reports. Reduces the protocol's reliance on the implementer correctly formatting JSON.
- `plan_quality` field on `PlanResult` (`rough` | `actionable` | `rigorous`). Separate axis from `plan_verdict` — tracks "how close to ship-ready" rather than "is this dispatchable." Reviewer-emitted with a server sanity check (critical findings or `fail` verdict force `rough`; missing/invalid values fall back to verdict-based default).
- `unverifiable_codebase_claim` finding category: lets the reviewer explicitly flag plan or task-spec statements it cannot verify from text alone (field names, signatures, file paths, repo conventions) rather than silently passing or fabricating critiques. Server enforces `severity: minor` for this category. Applies to `validate_plan` and `validate_task_spec` (both text-only inputs); not applied to `check_progress` / `validate_completion` which receive code.
- `malformed_evidence` finding category: the new `validate_completion` evidence-shape guard rejects submissions that contain truncation markers (`(truncated)`, `[truncated]`, `// ... unchanged`, etc.) or empty `final_files.Path` entries — saves strong-model time on cycles that were driven by tooling friction rather than correctness. Replaces the (misleading) previous reuse of `payload_too_large` for shape failures. Note: if the file you're submitting legitimately contains one of these literal strings, send a complete `final_diff` instead of pasting the file via `final_files`.
- `examples/lightweight-dispatch.md` reference template for trivial tasks (doc edits, mechanical relocations).

### Changed
- `check_progress` demoted from RECOMMENDED to OPTIONAL in the dispatch-clause template. Field data showed 0 substantive catches across 5 representative tasks; the call is now advisory.
- `validate_completion` rejected-submissions are cached for 5 minutes by canonical content hash to short-circuit identical re-submissions (see the new `malformed_evidence` category above).
- `validate_completion` now accepts an empty `session_id` when `final_files`, `final_diff`, or `test_evidence` is non-empty — supports the new lightweight protocol mode. The reviewer is called with a synthesized task spec (Goal = `args.Summary`, no ACs).
- `summary_block` population moved to the marshalling helpers (`envelopeResult` / `planEnvelopeResult`) so every exit path — happy paths, partial-recovery, legacy-truncation, `notFoundEnvelope`, `tooLargeEnvelope`, `noHeadingsPlanResult`, evidence-shape rejection — populates the field automatically.

### Removed

### Documentation
- New `## Scope and limits` section in `INTEGRATION.md` explicitly documents the text-only architectural boundary: what the tool catches, what it structurally cannot (codebase symbol existence, function signatures, repo-wide invariants encoded elsewhere, CI/test policy), and the recommendation to pair with a codebase-aware review for any plan that lands in real code.
- New `### Lightweight protocol mode` section in `INTEGRATION.md` documents the controller-side convention for trivial tasks.

Closes [#12](https://github.com/patiently/anti-tangent-mcp/issues/12).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `max_tokens_override` optional arg on all four tools (`validate_task_spec`, `check_progress`, `validate_completion`, `validate_plan`) for per-call control over the reviewer's output-token budget. Clamped to `ANTI_TANGENT_MAX_TOKENS_CEILING` (default 16384); over-ceiling values emit a `minor` clamp finding so the behaviour is visible. Negative values are rejected at the handler boundary.
- `mode: "quick" | "thorough"` optional arg on `validate_plan`. `quick` instructs the reviewer to surface at most 3 most-severe findings per scope (plan-level and each task) and omit stylistic nits; `thorough` (default) preserves prior behavior. Invalid values are rejected at the handler boundary.
- `partial: true` field on `Result` and `PlanResult` envelopes when the reviewer's response was truncated at the `max_tokens` cap but partial findings could be recovered. Marshaled with `omitempty` so the field is absent in the common (non-truncated) case.
- Hypothetical-marker guardrail (`e.g. illustrative —` prefix) added as a 4th paragraph in the `## Reviewer ground rules` block in `validate_plan` templates, complementing the 0.2.1 epistemic-boundary work.
- `next_action` specificity nudge in `validate_plan` templates: the field must name the single highest-leverage finding, not generic advice.
- `ANTI_TANGENT_MAX_TOKENS_CEILING` env var (default 16384) caps the per-call `max_tokens_override` value.

### Changed
- The synthetic truncation finding emitted on `max_tokens` cap hits is now `severity: minor` (was `major`), with wording that references both the env-var and `max_tokens_override` mitigations.

### Fixed
- Reviewer-output truncation no longer discards complete findings produced before the cap hit. All four tools now run truncated responses through a tolerant JSON parser and emit any recoverable findings alongside a downgraded (`minor`) truncation marker. Previously, ~9 KB of plan input could yield zero usable feedback when the reviewer's output cap was reached mid-response. Closes [#10](https://github.com/patiently/anti-tangent-mcp/issues/10).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- `validate_plan` prompt templates (`plan.tmpl`, `plan_findings_only.tmpl`, `plan_tasks_chunk.tmpl`) now include a `## Reviewer ground rules` block that pins the reviewer's epistemic horizon to the plan text — no claims about behavior of code symbols the reviewer cannot see. `unstated_assumption` findings are constrained to assumption gaps visible in the plan itself, and every finding's `evidence` field must point at plan text (present or expected-but-absent). Closes [#8](https://github.com/patiently/anti-tangent-mcp/issues/8).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `validate_completion` accepts optional `final_diff` evidence for unified diffs.
- Stateful hook envelopes include optional `session_expires_at` and `session_ttl_remaining_seconds`.
- Reviewer-response truncation is detected and surfaced as structured findings with max-token retry guidance.

### Changed
- **(breaking)** `validate_completion` now requires at least one of `final_files`, `final_diff`, or `test_evidence` to be non-empty. Summary-only completion requests are rejected with `validate_completion: at least one of final_files, final_diff, or test_evidence must be non-empty`. Migration: include test command output in `test_evidence` (smallest path), a unified diff in `final_diff`, or full files in `final_files`. Rationale: the reviewer prompt rewrite grades against concrete evidence; summary text alone caused the over-firing pattern in #6 §3.
- Default `ANTI_TANGENT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` is 180s.
- Timeout errors include the configured timeout and `ANTI_TANGENT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`.
- Invalid model override errors list supported models for the selected provider.
- `validate_completion` review guidance grades `final_files` / `final_diff` / `test_evidence` (not the `summary`), treats the task spec's `Context:` block as authoritative when it disambiguates an AC, and biases ambiguous-but-fully-covered evidence toward `verdict: pass` with a `category: quality` finding while reserving `severity: major`/`critical` for affirmative contradictions or for an AC left unaddressed.
- `validate_plan` chunk prompts ask reviewers to echo the `Task N:` prefix verbatim.
- Payload-too-large findings include tool-specific retry suggestions (`final_diff`-or-split for `validate_completion`; smaller `changed_files`-or-split for `check_progress`).

### Fixed
- Chunked `validate_plan` identity reconciliation accepts task titles when reviewers strip the `Task N:` prefix while still rejecting wrong or duplicate tasks.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `validate_plan` now automatically chunks large plans so reviewer responses don't truncate mid-JSON. Plans with more than `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_TASKS_PER_CHUNK` tasks (default 8) are reviewed via one Pass-1 plan-findings call plus `ceil(n/N)` per-chunk calls; the merged `PlanResult` is identical in shape to the single-call path. Plans of 8 tasks or fewer take the existing single-call path unchanged.
- Three new optional env vars: `ANTI_TANGENT_PER_TASK_MAX_TOKENS` (default 4096) governs output budget for `validate_task_spec` / `check_progress` / `validate_completion`; `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_MAX_TOKENS` (default 4096) governs output budget for `validate_plan` (single-call and per-chunk); `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_TASKS_PER_CHUNK` (default 8) sets both the chunking threshold and per-chunk task count. All three reject zero / negative / non-integer values at startup.
- Per-chunk identity validation: the chunked path verifies every returned `task_title` matches one of the requested chunk's headings (no duplicates, exact count). Mismatch triggers the existing retry-once path; second failure surfaces as an error rather than partial results.
- Gated e2e test `TestValidatePlan_E2E_LargePlanChunked` (build tag `e2e` + `ANTI_TANGENT_E2E_LARGE=1`) exercising the chunked path against a live OpenAI reviewer with a 25-task plan.

### Fixed
- `validate_plan` returning `decode plan result: EOF` on plans of ~12+ tasks. Root cause was a hardcoded `MaxTokens: 4096` cap that the reviewer's JSON response was overflowing on dense plans; both the cap is now configurable and the chunking path keeps each individual response well within budget.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `google:gemini-3.1-pro-preview` and `google:gemini-3.1-flash-lite` to the reviewer-model allowlist (verified via the Gemini `models.list` endpoint as supporting `generateContent`).
- `openai:gpt-5.5` and `openai:gpt-5.4-mini` (bare-name aliases that route to the latest dated snapshot). Verified live against `/v1/chat/completions` with `response_format: json_object`. The dated `gpt-5.5-2026-04-23` and `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17` entries remain for callers who want pinned snapshots.
- README and `INTEGRATION.md`: opencode (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) registration example, and a "Supported reviewer models" table grouped by provider so callers can see what `ANTI_TANGENT_*_MODEL` accepts at a glance.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Release workflow: write the release-notes file to `$RUNNER_TEMP` instead of the checkout directory. The previous path (`.release-notes.md` in the work tree) made GoReleaser see a dirty git state and refuse to publish. Moving the file outside the work tree keeps the tree clean and lets GoReleaser run end-to-end without `--skip=validate`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added 
- Extending .gitignore with claude droppings
- Fixing release task 

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Initial release. MCP server (`anti-tangent-mcp`) exposing three tools that
  review implementing-subagent work at the start, middle, and end of a task:
  - `validate_task_spec` — checks structural completeness, AC quality, and
    unstated assumptions before coding begins.
  - `check_progress` — flags scope drift, untouched ACs, and unaddressed
    prior findings during implementation.
  - `validate_completion` — walks every AC and non-goal in a final review.
- Multi-provider reviewer support: Anthropic Messages API (tool_use),
  OpenAI Chat Completions (json_schema), Google Gemini generateContent
  (responseSchema). Per-hook model defaults overridable per call.
- In-memory session store with configurable TTL (default 4h).
- Cross-platform binaries via GoReleaser (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64).
- Distroless static container image published to ghcr.io.
- GitHub Actions CI (changelog enforcement, `go test -race`) and release
  workflow (commit-tag-driven semver bump, tag, GoReleaser, GHCR push).
- `validate_plan` MCP tool — plan-level handoff gate that reviews an entire implementation plan in one call and proposes ready-to-paste structured-header blocks (Goal / Acceptance criteria / Non-goals / Context) for tasks that lack them. Replaces the per-task plan-handoff loop.
- `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_MODEL` env var — overrides the model used by `validate_plan`. Defaults to `ANTI_TANGENT_PRE_MODEL`.
