# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `google:gemini-3-pro` and `google:gemini-3.1-flash` to the reviewer-model allowlist.
- README and `INTEGRATION.md`: opencode (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) registration example, and a "Supported reviewer models" table grouped by provider so callers can see what `ANTI_TANGENT_*_MODEL` accepts at a glance.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Release workflow: write the release-notes file to `$RUNNER_TEMP` instead of the checkout directory. The previous path (`.release-notes.md` in the work tree) made GoReleaser see a dirty git state and refuse to publish. Moving the file outside the work tree keeps the tree clean and lets GoReleaser run end-to-end without `--skip=validate`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added 
- Extending .gitignore with claude droppings
- Fixing release task 

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Initial release. MCP server (`anti-tangent-mcp`) exposing three tools that
  review implementing-subagent work at the start, middle, and end of a task:
  - `validate_task_spec` — checks structural completeness, AC quality, and
    unstated assumptions before coding begins.
  - `check_progress` — flags scope drift, untouched ACs, and unaddressed
    prior findings during implementation.
  - `validate_completion` — walks every AC and non-goal in a final review.
- Multi-provider reviewer support: Anthropic Messages API (tool_use),
  OpenAI Chat Completions (json_schema), Google Gemini generateContent
  (responseSchema). Per-hook model defaults overridable per call.
- In-memory session store with configurable TTL (default 4h).
- Cross-platform binaries via GoReleaser (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64).
- Distroless static container image published to ghcr.io.
- GitHub Actions CI (changelog enforcement, `go test -race`) and release
  workflow (commit-tag-driven semver bump, tag, GoReleaser, GHCR push).
- `validate_plan` MCP tool — plan-level handoff gate that reviews an entire implementation plan in one call and proposes ready-to-paste structured-header blocks (Goal / Acceptance criteria / Non-goals / Context) for tasks that lack them. Replaces the per-task plan-handoff loop.
- `ANTI_TANGENT_PLAN_MODEL` env var — overrides the model used by `validate_plan`. Defaults to `ANTI_TANGENT_PRE_MODEL`.
